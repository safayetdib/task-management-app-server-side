# Task Management App Server Side

This project is the server-side implementation of a Task Management App. It provides a RESTful API for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks stored in a MongoDB database. The server is built using Node.js and Express.js, along with other libraries such as MongoDB, cors, and dotenv.

## Technologies Used

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server-side.
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/): A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the creation of robust APIs.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): A NoSQL document database that provides high performance, scalability, and flexibility for storing and retrieving data.
- [cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors): A middleware package for Express.js that enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and allows requests from different origins.
- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv): A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.
